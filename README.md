# Educational Data Mining project on ENEM database 2019.

This is my project from the conclusion work of my IT undergraduation.

Educational Data Mining is a technique where Machine Learning algorithms are used on educational databases in order to analyse its data, support Menage Tools or predict educational outcomes. It helps public and private institutions to increase the education quality.
